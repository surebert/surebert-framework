Welcome to a new surebert framework.  If you have questions you can email paulsidekick@gmail.com

GETTING STARTED:
Download composer in order to download the required dependencies.

Composer can be found at http://getcomposer.org/download/

OR you can download it using
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

One it is installed switch to your surebert applications / and type
composer.phar install

This will install the framework modules required.

Once they are installed you can begin working on your project.  You will need to serve your applications /public
directory.  This can be done via apache on nginx in production but you can simply user php 5.4 new built in server
for testing.  To do so cd into the /public directory and type

php -S 127.0.0.1:9000

Immediately you will see you projects /private/view/index.view file served.
