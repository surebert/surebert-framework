Switch to surebert v4.5
Major refactoring of $, s$, and sb.nodeList in order to speed them up and make them more extensible

$ Uses document.querySelectorAll() when available Safari 3, Firefox 3.1, IE 8+
Both $ and s$ both return 

sb.element.prototype's use Element.prototype where it exists and fall back to 


removed sb.element.infuse (e.g. sb.infuse = sb.objects.infuse;)
removed sb.infuse - just use sb.objects.infuse or set per script


complete rewrite of $, s$, and sb.nodeList
$ returns sb.nodeList now

Fix for sb.element.setOpacity() and sb.element.setStyle('opacity', 0.2); in IE that makes it work with elements that don't have position

moved sb.colors.dec2hex and sb.colors.hex2dec into their own files

Moved the following to their own files:
sb.strings.trim
sb.strings.toElement
sb.strings.isNumeric
sb.strings.escapeHTML

sb.element.prototype.wh
sb.element.prototype.infuse
sb.element.prototype.hide

added
sb.utils.debugWin

now most all sb.element prototypes return the element itself for chaining.  Before only some did this, the only ones that do not are obvious ones like getX, getY, getWidth etc hich all return the values they are getting

sb.element.event returns the element instead of the event = the event is held in this.lastEventAdded and is also pushe dinto the this.addedEvents array
completely rewrote sb.nodeList to automatciallly append prototypes from sb.element to itself so that you can call the same methods on the nodeList and the results are applied to each child.

changed sb.element.prototype.opacity to sb.element.prototype.setOpacity and moved to its own file
moved sb.element.prototype.isDescendentOf to its own file - DOES NOT REUTRN ITSELF LIKE OTHER sb.element.prototypes

moved sb.nodeList.prototype.parents to its own file

removed sb.dom.addPosition - moved code into sb.element.prototype.getPosition got rid of sb.element.prototype.addPositionRel and sb.element.prototype.addPositionMinusScroll instead favoring
new sb.element().getPosition({pos : 'rel'});
new sb.element().getPosition({accountForScrollBar : 1});
dropped sb.element.addPosition();
dropped sb.element.addPositonRelative();
dropped sb.element.addPositionMinusScroll();

dropped sb.dom.addDimensions(el);
and moved functionality to sb.element.prototype.getDimensions() which was previously an alias to it.

removed sb.styles.copy into sb.element.prototype.copyStyles() which is in its own file
removed sb.styles.write into sb.element.prototype.styles() which was not an alias before

sb.element.prototype.setStyle(prop, val);
sb.element.prototype.getStyle(prop);
updated sb.element.prototype.styles(paramsObj); to filter through sb.element.prototype.setStyle which translates when necessary i.e. opacity, camel case, etc

removed sb.dom.remove() just use sb.element.prototype.remove();
removed sb.dom.replace just use sb.element.prototype.replace();
removed sb.dom.toggle
removed sb.dom.txt - just use document.createTextNode

sb.elemnt.resizeTo, added argument param onWidthChanged and onHeightChanged

added sb.element.prototype.s$
allows you to get a selection inside of any super element
e.g. 
var myDiv = s$('#myDiv');
//all the p tags with class red inside myDiv
myDiv.s$('.red');

because of this I removed sb.element.prototype.getElementsByClassName

var comments = s$(entry.getElementsByClassName('comments')[0]);

//is now 
var comments = entry.s$('.comments')[0];

removed sb.dom.className and added the props to sb.element.prototype directly

removed sb.element.prototype.toggleClassName, use has/add remove if you want this

sb.consol.log now escapes HTML again as it should have.

sb.ie6 now defaults to type text when creating sb.element input that does not have the type specified
