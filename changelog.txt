Completely re-wrote flashGate.js and Surebert.swf using Flex Builder and AS3.  Source avaiable at http://surebert.com/svn/flashgate.  Usage differs slight from old flashGate, please check flashgate.js for notes.

changed sb.ajax.defaultMethod to post from get.  If you want to still have it backwards compatible set sb.ajax.defaultMethod = 'get';  

added new boolean response type to sb.ajax that accepts 0 or 1 with content type boolean/value from the server and then returns true or false boolean to the response handler.

moved sb.element.prototype.copyStyles to its own file
moved sb.element.prototype.disableSelection to its own file


------MAJOR CHANGES to sb.element and sb.nodeList:
now most all sb.element prototypes return the element itself for chaining.  Before only some did this, the only ones that do not are obvious ones like getX, getY, getWidth etc hich all return the values they are getting

sb.element.event returns the element instead of the event = the event is held in this.lastEventAdded and is also pushe dinto the this.addedEvents array
completely rewrote sb.nodeList to automatciallly append prototypes from sb.element to itself so that you can call the same methods on the nodeList and the results are applied to each child.

changed sb.element.prototype.opacity to sb.element.prototype.setOpacity and moved to its own file
moved sb.element.prototype.isDescendentOf to its own file - DOES NOT REUTRN ITSELF LIKE OTHER sb.element.prototypes

moved sb.nodeList.prototype.parents to its own file

removed sb.dom.addPosition - moved code into sb.element.prototype.getPosition got rid of sb.element.prototype.addPositionRel and sb.element.prototype.addPositionMinusScroll instead favoring
new sb.element().getPosition({pos : 'rel'});
new sb.element().getPosition({accountForScrollBar : 1});
dropped sb.element.addPosition();
dropped sb.element.addPositonRelative();
dropped sb.element.addPositionMinusScroll();

dropped sb.dom.addDimensions(el);
and moved functionality to sb.element.prototype.getDimensions() which was previously an alias to it.

removed sb.styles.copy into sb.element.prototype.copyStyles() which is in its own file
removed sb.styles.write into sb.element.prototype.styles() which was not an alias before

sb.element.prototype.setStyle(prop, val);
sb.element.prototype.getStyle(prop);
updated sb.element.prototype.styles(paramsObj); to filter through sb.element.prototype.setStyle which translates when necessary i.e. opacity, camel case, etc
removed sb.css and moved that code to sb.element.prototype.css which was an alias of it and moved it into its own file - use for backward compat

removed sb.dom.remove() just use sb.element.prototype.remove();
removed sb.dom.replace just use sb.element.prototype.replace();
removed sb.dom.toggle

sb.elemnt.resizeTo, added argument param onWidthChanged and onHeightChanged

added sb.element.prototype.s$
allows you to get a selection inside of any super element
e.g. 
var myDiv = s$('#myDiv');
//all the p tags with class red inside myDiv
myDiv.s$('.red');

because of this I removed sb.element.prototype.getElementsByClassName

var comments = s$(entry.getElementsByClassName('comments')[0]);

//is now 
var comments = entry.s$('.comments')[0];

sb.consol.log now escapes HTML again as it should have.

sb.ie6 now defaults to type text when creating sb.element input that does not have the type specified
